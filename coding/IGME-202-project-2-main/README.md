# Project 2 ASTEROIDS

### Student Info

-   Name: AJ Wagner
-   Section: 5

### Description

_A brief explanation of your project_

- This game is for the second Project of the class. It is a version of asteroids that utilizes the movement mechanics we made in
  Exercise 5 and the collision detection in Exercise 6. This game required implementation of moving asteroids, a firing mechanic,
  a way to destroy asteroids into smaller ones, a way to lose, and a way to keep score. On top of that, I added the ability to
  reset the game in the events that you lose by pressing R, which allows the game to be replayed without having to reload it.
  Depending on how big the window is, the background may not be able to fill the screen, but on smaller views it can.

### User Responsibilities

-   _What the user will need to do in the program_
-   _Include user interaction: keys to press, mouse buttons to click/drag, etc._

- In the game, the player will be able to control a spaceship with W, A, and D. S was not needed for implementation, as logically
  it would not make sense. The player can fire missiles from the ship using the spacebar, and has a lockout on firing to make sure
  they cannot spam fire to win. The game starts automatically upon opening, so there is nothing the user has to do to begin the game
  the first time.

### Known Issues

_List any errors, lack of error checking, or specific information that I need to know to run your program_

- There are no errors that I can find at this time.

### Requirements not completed

_If you did not complete a project requirement, notate that here_

- I do not believe I have missed anything from the rubric.

### Sources

-   _List all project sources here –models, textures, sound clips, assets, etc._
-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

- These were the assets I used for the spaceship and asteroids. They are the same ones I used for Exercise 6. For the bullet, I used
  a color changed motorcycle from the list of images given in Exercise 5.
